          <h1>The Infertility curse</h1>
<h2><i>By Bryan “Smokin Joe” Kariuki</i></h2>
“Why aren’t you pregnant what is wrong with you are you cursed “That is what Jacqueline Mukami (real name withheld) was asked by her mother-in law recently.
“I cry a lot alone no one comforts you everybody isolates you including your husband”. she says amid sobs while holding her handkerchief.
“If you are not going to do what comes naturally I will marry another wife and kick you out”. Her husband always retorts every evening when he comes home drunk.
”He has even stopped taking my food and sleeps in the guest bedroom. Sometimes I feel like committing suicide”. She sobs. Each year is her annus horribilis just because she can’t conceive.

          <h1 >All blacks: The greatest sports team in ever</h1>
    <h3><i>By Smokin’ Joe</i></h3><br>
    <p><font size="+2">W</font>ith Manchester City beating Manchester United 3-1 a few weeks ago  and seemingly looking comfortable and not even straining while doing it. It boggles the mind what they can achieve this season.
 They even look much stronger than last season where they were the first team in premier league history to reach 100 points out of a possible 114 and they were also the first team in history to score over 100 goals (they scored 106 goals).
There closest rival, Manchester united was 19 points adrift. Currently in the 2018/2019 they have garnered 32 points out of a possible 33(we are 12 games into the season)
 It is absolutely frightening what this 2018/2019 city team could also achieve and this does not bode well for other teams in the league and are they creating a dynasty?
This has brought about a conversation as to which is the greatest sports team in history.

          <p><h2><i>Locusta; World’s first serial killer and assassin of Emperors</i></h2><br>
            <h3><i>By Smokin’ Joe</i></h3><br>
            <p><font size="+2">L</font>ocusta was a notorious poison maker who was active in the Claudius-Nero reign around 1ST Century Roman Empire. She was born in Gaul and as a young girl was taught about the healing herbs and the poisonous herbs.
            When she came of age she went to Rome during Emperor Claudius Reign. During that time in the ‘’Eternal city” assassinations were rife especially among nobility.
            Therefore Locusta found herself at home as she marketed herself as a posion maker. It is said that she considered poison making her magnum opus. Thus she had a booming business especially among the nobility.
